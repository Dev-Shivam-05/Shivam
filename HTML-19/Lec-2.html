				<h1><em>The Hook</em></h1>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				A young couple was driving home from a date one night when they heard a news bulletin on the radio. A dangerous criminal had escaped from a nearby prison, and police were warning people to be on the lookout. The couple was a little nervous, but they continued driving.

				As they got further out into the country, the roads became dark and deserted. <strong><em><ins>The couple started to get scared.</ins></em></strong>The girl said that she wanted to go home, but the boy said that they were almost there.

				Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. The boy stopped the car and they both looked around, but they didn't see anything. They continued driving, but they were both very scared.

				They were almost home when they heard another loud noise. The boy stopped the car again and they both looked around. This time, they saw something.

				It was a man with a hook for a hand. He was standing in the middle of the road, and he was looking right at them.

				The boy quickly started the car and drove away. They didn't stop until they got to the girl's house.

				The couple was very shaken up by what they had seen. They went inside and locked the doors. They didn't feel safe until the police caught the man with the hook.

				The End
